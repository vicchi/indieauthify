A work-in-progress [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com/) server implementation, in Python, using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [indieweb-utils](https://github.com/capjamesg/indieweb-utils).

There are sharp edges here and it's not even remotely deployable yet.
